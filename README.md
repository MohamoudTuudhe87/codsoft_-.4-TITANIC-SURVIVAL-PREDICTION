# üö¢ Titanic Survival Prediction Project 

## üéØ Project Overview 

The Titanic Survival Prediction project aims to predict the likelihood of survival for passengers aboard the Titanic based on features such as passenger class, age, gender, and fare. Using machine learning techniques, we analyze the dataset and create predictive models while uncovering key insights that affected survival rates.

## üìù Project Description
In this project, we use the Titanic dataset from Kaggle, which contains demographic and ticket information about passengers. This is a binary classification problem: predicting whether a passenger survived (1) or did not survive (0).

### Key Steps:
**Data Cleaning**: Addressing missing values, encoding categorical data, and normalizing numerical features.   
**Feature Engineering**: Creating new features (e.g., FamilySize, extracting titles from Name).    
**Modeling**: Testing multiple machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.   
**Evaluation**: Assessing models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## üìÇ Data Structure

The dataset consists of the following columns:

| Column Name | Description                                     | Data Type |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| PassengerId | Unique identifier for each passenger           | Integer   |
| Survived    | Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)              | Integer   |
| Pclass      | Passenger class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd class)       | Integer   |
| Name        | Name of the passenger                          | String    |
| Sex         | Gender of the passenger (male/female)           | String    |
| Age         | Age of the passenger                           | Float     |
| SibSp       | Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic | Integer   |
| Parch       | Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic | Integer   |
| Ticket      | Ticket number                                  | String    |
| Fare        | Passenger fare                                 | Float     |
| Cabin       | Cabin number                                   | String    |
| Embarked    | Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton) | String    |


## üîß Tools and Libraries
The following tools and libraries were used in this project:

**Python:** The core language used for development.   
**Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.  
**NumPy:** For numerical computations.  
**Scikit-learn:** For model building, training, and evaluation.  
**Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization.  
**Jupyter Notebook:** For running and documenting the code interactively.

## üìä Visualizations
We created various visualizations to better understand the dataset:

**Survival Rate by Gender:** A bar plot showing that women had a higher survival rate than men.  
**Survival Rate by Passenger Class:** Showing that first-class passengers had a better survival rate.  
**Age Distribution:** A histogram to analyze the distribution of ages and its correlation with survival.

## üîç Project Insights & Learnings
Key insights derived from this project include:

**Gender Influence:** Women were far more likely to survive than men.  
**Class Matters:** First-class passengers had a higher likelihood of survival compared to those in third class.  
**Age Correlation:** Younger passengers had a slightly higher survival rate, especially children.  
**Family Size:** Passengers traveling with small family sizes had a better chance of survival than those traveling alone.

### Challenges Faced:
Handling missing data, particularly in the Age and Cabin columns, required careful imputation.  
Imbalanced dataset, where most passengers did not survive, which posed challenges for accurate model predictions.

## üîÆ Recommendations for Future Work
**Advanced Feature Engineering:** Explore more feature combinations like Title from the Name column and the relationship between the cabin deck and survival.   
**Ensemble Learning:** Combining multiple models to improve prediction accuracy.  
**Handling Class Imbalance:** Implement strategies like oversampling or SMOTE to handle the imbalance in survival classes.  
**Model Interpretability:** Use SHAP values to understand the contribution of each feature.  
## üöÄ Conclusion
The Titanic Survival Prediction project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to predict passenger survival on the Titanic using various passenger attributes. Through feature engineering and careful model selection, we achieved a robust predictive model that provides insights into the factors influencing survival. The Random Forest model performed the best, with an accuracy of XX% on the test data.
